Technical Analysis believes 
Fundamental Analysis 

For Technical Analysis we used Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average(SARIMA),commonly used in Time Series Forecasting

## Motivation
I have been a avid follower of Apple as I like their products.The company has excited me and started to read into their financial quarter reports .
While doing my Finance Minors I came across Business Valuation and found it fasinating to value the company .
I valued Apple by sincerely following Prof. Aswath Damodaran's guide to valuation. After coming across Data Mining courses I found it interesting to predict Apple Stock Price using Time Series Forecasting Methodologies like ARIMA.
I then had a thought about how would both techniques compare with each other.
