# Time-Series Forecasting-Apple Stock Price Using SARIMA & Prophet

## Project Overview 
Comparision between **Time Series Analysis Vs Fundamental Analysis for Apple Inc**.
Time Series Analysis uses historical patterns, seasonality to predict the future values by developing mathematical models that capture the series.
We used **Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average(SARIMA) & Prophet** for Time Series Forecasting.

Fundamental Analysis is established on foundations of economics,financial reports and researching several business/industry aspects. We take a look at financial ratios, balance sheets,domestic & global business environments,etc. At the end we arrive at conclusion of whether the security is undervalued or overvalued.
We used **Intrinsic Valuation** in our case.

## Motivation
I have been an avid follower of Apple as I like their products. Being excited about them led me to read into their history.
While pursuing my Finance Minors, I came across Business Valuation techniques and found it fascinating to value the company.
I valued Apple by sincerely following Prof. Aswath Damodaran's guide to valuation. After coming across Data Mining courses, I found it interesting to predict Apple Stock Price using Time Series Forecasting Methodologies like ARIMA.
Out of my curiosity, I questioned how would both the techniques compare with each other?

## Problem Type
Forecasting Problem.
**Result Metrics**
Mean Squared Error(MSE),Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE), R2 Score.(Time Series)
Overvalued or Undervalued (Fundamental Analysis)


## Actionable Insight
Whether to Invest in the underlying Stock/Security or Not.

## Libraries Used
**Pandas**            **Matplotlib**        **Sklearn**            **Seaborn **
**Statsmodels **      **Scipy **            **fbprophet**
